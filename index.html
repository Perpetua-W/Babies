        <p class="intro">
          I Know you wonder what or who is N Cubed. Well, these are the initials of my 3 babies, my loves,
          my world, my everything in one.These three ninja's have brought so much joy in my life that when
          i just think of them i find myself smilling and once in a while shed a tear of joy.

          Well, the work of raising them comes with its own challenges and there are days i feel like running
          away for sure.All in all, sometimes when i need <strong><em>a miracle</em></strong> i look into <strong><em>my
              babies eyes</em></strong>
          and realize i have already created one.

      <h2>NATHAN</h2>
      <p2>Our big man bazu.He is the first fruit of my womb. He was such a calm baby and is still is up to date. He is 8
        years old
        and a serious gammer. When He is not glued to His video games, He is out riding His bicycle or being
        cheeky with His sister.

        He is my little helper when i get overwhelmed with His brother and you cannot miss to see the unconditonal
        love He has for his siblings.

        <strong>My Love Nate "May God bless you as you learn and grow, and fill your heart with his love wherever you
          go."</strong>

      <h2>NATANIELA</h2>
      <p2>She is our diva, the second fruit of my womb. She is too smart and witty for a 4 year old, the one who refused
        to learn
        swahili and instead chose the path of British english. Did i mention you will struggle to here her words?! yes
        you will, the accent is so heavy you would think She lives in the UK.

        She is curious in nature and many are the times She has caused disaters in the house during Her exploration.
        A sassy one and loves to look pretty, so make up, beautiful dresses and adorable head gears are close
        to her heart.

        <strong>My Love Noni "May Jesus live within your heart, Keep you in His care, guide and guard you, day and night
          and answer your every prayer"</strong>

      <h2>NOAH</h2>
      <p2>Our chubby cheeks. He is the third fruit of my womb. My last born...yes!! the last one. He joined
        us 8 months ago and it has never been a dull moment with Him being around. He is feisty and strong, a go getter
        who is relentless in fighting for what He wants.

        Our smilling and laughing machine. The one whose nickname is not coined from His actual Name...a
        story for another day..His siblings want to hoover around Him always, an indication of His gentle and
        caring nature

          protect you, May the prescence of God watch over you"</strong>
